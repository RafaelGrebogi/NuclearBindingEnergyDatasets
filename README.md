# NuclearBindingEnergyDatasets
Datasets used in "Approximating the Nuclear Binding Energy Using Analytic Continued Fractions" paper.

Each file contains the nuclear binding energy per nucleon (target) and the related features (input) used.


## File Description
- *NBE_2023_Exper_Train.csv* contains stable and unstable nuclides with experimentally observed nuclear binding energy per nucleon values from the AME2020. This dataset is used for the training task.

- *NBE_2023_Exper_Train.csv* contains stable and unstable nuclides with estimated nuclear binding energy per nucleon values from the AME2020. This dataset is used for the testing task.

- *NBE_2023_Stable_Train.csv* contains 96 stable nuclides, 12 long-lived nuclides and the tritium with experimentally observed nuclear binding energy per nucleon values from the AME2020. This dataset is used for the training task.

- *NBE_2023_Stable_Test.csv* contains 147 stable nuclides with experimentally observed nuclear binding energy per nucleon values from the AME2020. This dataset is used for the testing task.
